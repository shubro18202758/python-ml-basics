# Mathematical Foundations for Fraud Detection

## Overview

This directory contains comprehensive theoretical foundations and mathematical concepts essential for understanding fraud detection and anomaly detection systems. All content is purely narrative/educational—implementations are in the `code/` directory.

## Contents

1. **statistics-for-fraud-detection.md** - Statistical theory and probability distributions
2. **linear-algebra-for-ml.md** - Linear algebra concepts and their applications

## Key Topics Covered

### Statistics & Probability
- Probability distributions (Normal, Poisson, Exponential)
- Statistical hypothesis testing (Z-tests, Chi-square, Kolmogorov-Smirnov)
- Information theory (Entropy, KL-divergence)
- Bayesian inference and posterior updates
- Distribution fitting and anomaly detection

### Linear Algebra
- Distance metrics (Euclidean, Manhattan, Mahalanobis, Cosine)
- Matrix operations and transformations
- Eigendecomposition and SVD
- Covariance matrices and correlations
- Dimensionality reduction techniques

### Optimization
- Gradient descent and convergence
- Loss functions for classification
- Regularization techniques
- Cross-validation theory

## Learning Path

1. Start with **statistics-for-fraud-detection.md** to understand distributions and statistical tests
2. Move to **linear-algebra-for-ml.md** for geometric intuition
3. Review formulas and their fraud detection applications
4. Implement concepts using code examples in `code/math/` directory

## Mathematical Notation

All documents use standard mathematical notation with LaTeX rendering:
- $X \sim N(\mu, \sigma^2)$ for normal distribution
- $\nabla J(\theta)$ for gradients
- $|\mathbf{x}|_2$ for L2 norm
